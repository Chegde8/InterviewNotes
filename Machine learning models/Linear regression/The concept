Linear regression finds the best line that fits data. This is achieved by minimizing sum of squares (least squares).
First, let us understand how to fit the best line to given data.
To find the best fit line, the sum of squared distances between all the data points and the line is caclulated. The smaller this value, the better the fit. This is called the sum of squared residuals because residuals are the differences between real data and the line.
